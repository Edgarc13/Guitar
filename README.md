# The Evolution of the Guitar

#### By Edgar Castillo-Ramos

## Objectives and Applications

The guitar has a long and storied history that encompasses much of recorded history. It was my primary objective to display this history through this map. Understanding the spatial distribution of the instrument and its origins helps listeners contextualize the genres and playing styles of different instruments. This map can be used as a starting off point for research into different instruments.

Emphasis was placed on the use of video. Our ears pick up vast amounts of information that I could not describe through words. As such it was necessary to include videos to hear the evolution of the instrument

My second objective was to have a more interactable map than usual. I utilized the storytelling template from map box studio in order to create a story map esque map that literally takes you through history. Furthermore I utilized a second function in order to get rid of this feature so users can explore the map on their own.
